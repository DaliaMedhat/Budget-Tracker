# Project Overview
A single-page application is implemented that allows users to track their daily expenses and income, as well as see their current balance.

By pressing the plus button, the user can open a form to add a new record, which can be either an income or an expense. The balance is internally calculated and the user can see the current status.
A Record List is also shown with all of the records that were previously added.
The user is also able to delete any record.

As a visulaization tool, a pie chart is implemented. Whenever any record (income/expenses) is added, the pie chart appears. 
The total income and expenses is also stated to improve UX.
A slightly colorful background is also implemented with changing colors whenever hovering.
